# GBJAM 5 Game (untitled)  

I'm working on a game for the GBJAM 5 game jam at [itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-5). Feel free to follow along or fork whatever I've done here!  

The current plan for this game is a Link's Awakening-inspired dungeon crawler with some rogue-light elements (you lose your stuff when you die, etc.) My first priority is to get a working UI and playable character into the game; after that, pickups and enemies are crucial.  

Eventually, I want to incorporate some other features like:  
1. Random dungeon generation  
2. Persistent home base upgrades using the treasure you obtain  
3. Random, pick-up-able sub-weapons
